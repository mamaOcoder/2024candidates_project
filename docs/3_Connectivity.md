## Connectivity

In graph theory, connectivity is a fundamental concept that describes how nodes are connected to one another within a graph (see [Wikipedia page on graph connectivity] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)). There are different types of connectivity depending on whether the graph is directed or undirected, each providing insights into the graph's properties and behavior. Before describing the connectedness of the Senate and House hyperlink graphs, we define these concepts.
