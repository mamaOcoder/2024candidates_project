## 1. Data Collection

Candidates for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives 2024 elections were scraped from their respective Ballotpedia pages. [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page) is a nonprofit and nonpartisan online political encyclopedia that covers elections and public policy in the United States. The desired candidates lists were located within tables organized by state and contained information such as candidate name, party affiliation, office and candidacy status. Python’s “requests'' and “BeautifulSoup'' libraries were utilized to scrape the Ballotpedia webpages and extract the tables from the raw HTML content.

After identifying the required tables, additional preprocessing steps were necessary to clean the tables columns and append individual state’s tables into two Python dataframes: one for Senate candidates (dfs) and one for the House candidates (dfh). This process included extracting the “Incumbent” tag from within the candidate’s name column and introducing a new “incumbency” column. This involved identifying instances where candidates were tagged as "Incumbent" in their names, removing these tags, and creating a separate column to denote incumbency status.

A key aspect of this research involved collecting the Wikipedia page of each candidate. To achieve this, using the Python module [wikipediaapi](https://github.com/martin-majlis/Wikipedia-API), a function was created to check if a Wikipedia page for a given name existed. However, finding a page did not imply that it correctly corresponded to the candidate, necessitating additional validation and processing steps. This initial automated approach helped identify potential Wikipedia pages associated with each candidate’s name.

To ensure the Wikipedia pages identified were correct, we performed the following additional processing: manual verification and cross-referencing with other sources to confirm the accuracy. Wikipedia itself had a page for both the [2024 Senate elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Senate_elections) and the [House of Representative elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections), which provided links to a candidate’s personal wikipedia page if it existed. The tables in these Wikipedia pages were not as thorough or updated as the Ballotpedia tables, but served as an initial automated method to cross-reference results found from searching Wikipedia for the candidates’ names.

For candidates who did not have Wikipedia pages identified through automated means, further efforts were made to manually search and verify their pages. This involved using variations of their names and checking additional sources. This thorough process ensured that the dataset included the most accurate and comprehensive information possible.

Through this systematic approach, we ensured a comprehensive collection of candidate information, facilitating the construction of a robust network analysis based on the available Wikipedia pages for 2024 U.S. Senate and House of Representatives candidates. Next, we will discuss the creation of Senate and House hyperlink graphs using the validated Wikipedia pages for the collected data.
